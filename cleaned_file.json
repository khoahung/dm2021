useful2funny0cool0textThis used to be my car wash choice They did good enough job getting my car clean service is pretty quick staff is friendly and it is near my house I have been coming here since they changed ownership couple years ago \n\nI went by today to my car washed for first time since Covid started and found that no one was wearing face mask The guy that walked up to my car to ask what I wanted done wasnt wearing mask he didnt even seem to have one They were also going to my car to drive it through wash not wearing face mask Furthermore guy that wrote down price on piece paper actually licked his fingers to separate paper prior to handing it to me\n\nI asked to speak to owner since I have chatted with him during non-covid times The owner wasnt there but guy I spoke to told me owner was aware that no one was wearing masks and said it was completely optional We are middle pandemic and Austin is stage 4 and owner doesnt give shit about health and safety community that he serves It seems like they have done absolutely nothing to try to increase safety for employees and patrons \n\nThey not only missed out on $35 I was planning to pay them today for my car wash but have also lost any future business from me Do yourself favor and take your business elsewhere I certainly am planning todate2020-06-22 215410
