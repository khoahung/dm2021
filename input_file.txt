They did a good enough job getting my car clean, the service is pretty quick, the staff is friendly, and it is near my house. I have been coming here since they changed ownership a couple of years ago. \n\nI went by today to get my car washed for the first time since Covid started and found that no one was wearing a face mask. The guy that walked up to my car to ask what I wanted done wasn't wearing a mask (he didn't even seem to have one). They were also going to get in my car to drive it through the wash not wearing a face mask. Furthermore, the guy that wrote down the price on the piece of paper actually licked his fingers to separate the paper prior to handing it to me!\n\nI asked to speak to the owner since I have chatted with him during non-covid times. The owner wasn't there, but the guy I spoke to told me the owner was aware that no one was wearing masks and said it was completely optional. We are in the middle of a pandemic and Austin is in stage 4, and the owner doesn't give a shit about the health and safety of the community that he serves. It seems like they have done absolutely nothing to try to increase safety for employees and patrons. \n\nThey not only missed out on the $35 I was planning to pay them today for my car wash but have also lost any future business from me. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere! I certainly am planning to.","date":"2020-06-22 21:54:10"
