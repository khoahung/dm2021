It's a neat building that provides interesting ambience and the background music was very nice. The food and service, however, was so disappointing.  The shrimp and calamari appetizers were decent, but that's where it ended. The skirt steak was barely cooked and warmed (not browned) with no flavor. The lime chicken was over cooked and tasteless (other than lime).  Ceviche and most of the other tapas were subpar.  I have been to Spain many times and nothing here even resembles authentic Spanish cuisine. Although servers were friendly, the service was painfully slow and the servers are not well trained. There's lots to gripe about but I won't bother. Just never going back!  Unless they get new management, I'm quite sure sure this restaurant will be gone within a year.","date":"2018-05-24 23:00:28"}
